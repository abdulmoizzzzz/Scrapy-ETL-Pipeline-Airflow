# Scrapy-ETL-Pipeline-Airflow
I developed an automated ETL pipeline that leverages Scrapy to extract data from various websites and transform it into a structured format. Using Apache Airflow for orchestration, the data is seamlessly loaded into a MongoDB database for easy access and analysis, ensuring timely and efficient data collection.
